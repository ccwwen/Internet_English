Today, data has become a commercial capital, and data can create more than you can   imagine. 

The person who conducts data analysis knows the value of the data more, so he further  collects and mines personal data. 

This has led to Facebook's almost omniscient situation. 

For those who use Facebook, Facebook is probably the software that knows you the most, and even knows your social network. 

We know that there are laws and regulations that protect privacy, as well as the privacy  policy of “notice and permission”. 

But in fact, in many cases, we use a new app or website, and it will ask you to agree to all  the privacy terms, otherwise you will not be able to use the software.

 In order to use it, we can only agree to all the terms, then this "information" Is the privacy  policy of the license and the existence of a singular existence?

 In foreign countries, after everyone's struggle, we have realized that we can use an app  without agreeing to all the terms.

 For our country, this kind of privacy power struggle still has a long way to go.

 In the eraof big data, our personal privacy protection should be from personal permission  to the   responsibility of data users.  

The legal collection and legal use of data will be a matter of careful consideration for data   users.  

Information security depends on the updating and implementation of national policies and  the normative nature of data users.
